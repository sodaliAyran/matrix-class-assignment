Solution for Matrix Class Assignment for a Job Application.

Just a simple Matrix class written in Python.

I tried to answer only the questions in the PDF therefore most of the functions implemented in a regular 
Matrix Class is missing. (Like add or subtract but there is a multiply function which nice.)

You can Run the Code in Python(.py) File by your compiler or you can Run Jupyter Notebook File(.ipynb) in the browser
on one of the notebooks https://jupyter.org/ provides. I recommend latter.
